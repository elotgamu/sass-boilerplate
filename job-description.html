    <h2 id="information-we-share">INFORMATION WE SHARE</h2>
    <p>
        When you join the Talent Network or apply for a job through the Talent Network, we provide your Personal Information to the employer customer who has hired CareerBuilder to create and operate this Talent Network on its behalf, (including your e-mail address and other contact information that you publish on your resume). The employer customer may use your information to contact you directly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, when you join the Talent Network or apply for a job through the Talent Network, the information supplied by you is stored by CareerBuilder on a dedicated database on behalf of the employer customer.  In addition, the information supplied by you also may become part of the employer customer’s database. In that instance, the use of such information by the employer customer will be subject to the privacy policy of that company, and CareerBuilder is not responsible for that company’s use of your information. CareerBuilder is not responsible for what the employer customer, or any third party with whom you may share your Personal Information, subsequently does with your information.  You should review the privacy policy of the employer customer to ensure that you are comfortable with how it intends to use and disclose your information.
    </p>
    <p>
        The employer customer for whom we act as a service provider to operate this Talent Network will receive reports that contain non-personally identifiable information about its Talent Network. We also use non-personally identifiable information and certain technical information about your computer and your access of the Talent Network (including your internet protocol address) in order to operate, maintain and manage the Talent Network.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, we may combine certain non-personally identifiable aggregate data about our users and use such anonymous aggregate data to prepare reports for our users (typically employers or educators).  “Aggregate Data” is the demographic information (such as zip code, age, gender, race or ethnicity) and employment information (such as occupation, education and experience) of many individuals that is combined together.  Aggregate data is used to analyze the characteristics of various populations and does not identify any specific individuals.  For example, an employer may purchase a report from CareerBuilder that states the number of accountants with at least five year’s experience that live within a certain geographic area.  All such reports sold only contain aggregate data which cannot be used to identify any individuals.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other than instances where users opt to provide their Personal Information while registering to join the Talent Network, provide it via a job application, or otherwise provide permission to share it, we do not sell our users' Personal Information to anyone for any reason.  All users should be aware, however, that when they choose to display or distribute Personal Information (such as their email address or other contact information) via the Talent Network or any other distribution method, that information can be collected and used by others. This may result in unsolicited messages, for which CareerBuilder is not responsible, from third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
        <br>
        We also may share Personal Information with our service providers who help us in the delivery of our own products and services to you. These service providers may only use or disclose the information as necessary to perform services on our behalf or as otherwise required by law.
    </p>
    <p>
        CareerBuilder also may disclose specific user information when we determine, in good faith, that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law, to cooperate with or seek assistance from law enforcement, to prevent a crime or protect national security, or to protect the interests or safety of CareerBuilder or other users of the Talent Network.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, Personal Information we have collected may be passed on to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets or a bankruptcy or other corporate reorganization of CareerBuilder.

        submitted information that it deems necessary or appropriate, in its sole discretion. </p>

    <p><b>5.2 No endorsements by CareerBuilder.</b> Nothing on the Talent Network shall be considered an endorsement,
        representation or warranty with respect to any User or third party, whether in regards to its web site,
        products, services, hiring, experience, employment or recruiting practices, or otherwise. </p>

    <p><b>5.3 WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS. </b></p>

    <p>(a) THE TALENT NETWORK IS PROVIDED ON AN 'AS IS' BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.
        CAREERBUILDER, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
        THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTIES’ RIGHTS, AND FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR
        PURPOSE. CAREERBUILDER MAKES NO WARRANTIES ABOUT THE ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, COMPLETENESS, OR TIMELINESS OF THE
        TALENT NETWORK. </p>

    <p>(b) WITHOUT LIMITATION ON THE FOREGOING:

    </p>

    <p>(i) CAREERBUILDER DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE TALENT NETWORK WILL OPERATE ERROR-FREE OR THAT THE TALENT NETWORK AND
        ITS SERVERS ARE FREE OF COMPUTER VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL MECHANISMS. IF YOUR USE OF THE TALENT NETWORK RESULTS
        DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IN THE NEED FOR SERVICING OR REPLACING EQUIPMENT OR DATA, CAREERBUILDER IS NOT
        RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE COSTS.</p>

    <p>(ii) CAREERBUILDER MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR GUARANTEES REGARDING THE TRUTHFULNESS, ACCURACY, LEGALITY,
        COMPLETENESS, TIMELINESS OR RELIABILITY OF ANY DOCUMENTS POSTED BY USERS, OR OF ANY OTHER FORM OF COMMUNICATION
        ENGAGED IN BY USERS. DOCUMENTS MAY CONTAIN INACCURACIES OR TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS. YOU AGREE THAT ANY RELIANCE ON
        DOCUMENTS POSTED BY USERS, OR ON ANY OTHER FORM OF COMMUNICATION WITH USERS, WILL BE AT YOUR OWN RISK.</p>

    <p>(iii) CAREERBUILDER MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR GUARANTEES REGARDING THE CONTENT OF THE TALENT NETWORK,
        INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, BROKEN LINKS, INACCURACIES OR TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS. </p>

    <p>(iv) CAREERBUILDER MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR GUARANTEES REGARDING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SERVICES OR
        TIMELINESS OF THE SERVICES IN MEETING YOUR EMPLOYMENT OBJECTIVES. CAREERBUILDER DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE
        SERVICES WILL RESULT IN CANDIDATES BEING HIRED, POSITIONS BEING FILLED OR EMPLOYEES BEING RETAINED, AND IS NOT
        RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY BUSINESS, EMPLOYMENT, HIRING AND/OR SALARY DECISIONS, FOR WHATEVER REASON MADE,
        MADE BY YOU.</p>

    <p><b>5.4 DAMAGE LIMITATIONS, ALLOCATIONS OF LIABILITY AND EQUITABLE RELIEF.</b></p>

    <p>(a) YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY AND RISK FOR YOUR USE OF THE TALENT NETWORK, THE INTERNET GENERALLY, AND THE
        DOCUMENTS YOU POST OR ACCESS AND FOR YOUR CONDUCT ON AND OFF THE TALENT NETWORK.</p>

    <p>(b) IN NO EVENT SHALL CAREERBUILDER (OR ANY OF ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, SUBSIDIARIES,
        AFFILIATES, AGENTS OR ADVERTISERS), BE LIABLE FOR ANY NON-DIRECT DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT
        LIMITATION, INCIDENTAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS, OR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM LOST DATA, LOST
        EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) RESULTING FROM OR ARISING UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH SERVICES
        OR THE USE OR ACCESS TO, OR THE INABILITY TO USE OR ACCESS, THE TALENT NETWORK AND/OR ANY DOCUMENT, WHETHER
        BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT CAREERBUILDER IS ADVISED OF THE
        POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS SECTION SHALL NOT APPLY TO ANY PAYMENT AND INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS
        DESCRIBED HEREIN.</p>

    <p>(c) BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL
        OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IF ANY ARE
        HELD INAPPLICABLE OR UNENFORCEABLE FOR ANY REASON, THEN CAREERBUILDER'S MAXIMUM LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY
        NON-DIRECT TYPE OF DAMAGES SHALL BE LIMITED TO U.S. $200.00 IN THE AGGREGATE.</p>

    <p>(d) IN NO EVENT SHALL CAREERBUILDER (OR ANY OF ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, SUBSIDIARIES,
        AFFILIATES, AGENTS OR ADVERTISERS), BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT DAMAGES IN EXCESS IN THE AGGREGATE OF US$200.00.

    </p>

    <p>(e) DUE TO THE NATURE OF THIS AGREEMENT, IN ADDITION TO MONEY DAMAGES, YOU AGREE THAT CAREERBUILDER WILL BE
        ENTITLED TO EQUITABLE RELIEF UPON A BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT BY YOU.
    </p>

    <p><b>5.5 User Authentication. </b> Because User authentication on the Internet is difficult, CareerBuilder cannot
        and does not confirm that each User is who they claim to be. Because CareerBuilder does not and cannot be
        involved in User-to-User dealings or control the behavior of participants on the Talent Network, in the event
        that you have a dispute with one or more Users, you release CareerBuilder from claims, demands and damages
        (actual and consequential and direct and indirect) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and
        unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. </p>

    <p><b>5.6 California Residents. </b> If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542,
        which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in
        his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially
        affected his or her settlement with the debtor."</p>

    <p><b>6. Links to Other Sites.</b> The Talent Network may contain links to third party web sites. These links are
        provided solely as a convenience to you and not as an endorsement by CareerBuilder of the contents on such
        third-party web sites. CareerBuilder is not responsible for the content of linked third-party sites and does not
        make any representations regarding the content or accuracy of materials on such third-party web sites. If you
        decide to access linked third-party web sites, you do so at your own risk. </p>

    <p><b>7. Amendments to this Agreement and Changes to the Talent Network.</b> CareerBuilder may revise these Terms
        and Conditions at any time by updating this page. Changes will be binding on you on the date they are posted on
        the Talent Network (or as otherwise stated in any notice of such changes). Any use of the Talent Network will be
        considered acceptance by you of the then-current Terms and Conditions (including any exhibits thereto) contained
        on such Talent Network. If at any time you find the Terms and Conditions unacceptable, you must not use the
        applicable Talent Network any longer. Any new or different terms supplied by you are specifically rejected by
        CareerBuilder unless CareerBuilder agrees to them in a signed writing specifically including those new or
        different terms. CareerBuilder may change the Talent Network at any time. </p>

    <p><b>8. Indemnity.</b> You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless CareerBuilder (and its officers,
        directors, shareholders, employees, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents or advertisers) from and against any third
        party claims, actions or demands (including, without limitation, costs, damages and reasonable legal and
        accounting fees) alleging or resulting from or in connection with your use of the Talent Network, any Document
        posted by you, your use of the Services or your breach of this Agreement. CareerBuilder shall use reasonable
        efforts to provide you prompt notice of any such claim, suit, or proceeding and may assist you, at your expense,
        in defending any such claim, suit or proceeding.</p>

    <p><b>9.
        User Information and Privacy Policy.</b></p>

    <p><b>9.1</b> When you register on the Talent Network or in connection with the Services, you will be asked to
        create an account and provide CareerBuilder with certain information, including but not limited to, a valid
        email address (“User Information”). You acknowledge and agree that you have no ownership rights in your account.

        addition, third parties may retain cached copies of User Information.</p>

    <p><b>12.1
        Posting Rules:</b>
    </p>

    <p>(a) You may not post any Document to the Talent Network that contains: (i) URLs or links to web sites (to
        advertise your company or web site, see our Advertising Info page.); (ii) copyrighted material (unless you own
        the copyright or have the owner's permission to post the copyrighted material); (iii) trade secrets (unless you
        own them or have the owner's permission to post them); (iv) material that infringes on or misappropriates any
        other intellectual property rights, or violates the privacy or publicity rights of others; (v) keywords or white
        text keywords (including any words embedded in the Document and hidden from the User); (vi) anything that is
        discriminatory, sexually explicit, obscene, libelous, defamatory, threatening, harassing, abusive, or hateful;

        or misleading information, opinions or notices (commercial or otherwise) or chain letters; (iii) post
        advertisements, or solicitations of business (including, but not limited to, email processors, any pyramid
        scheme or “club membership”). </p>

    <p>(c) Your Document(s) must contain sufficient detail to convey clearly to the Employer your qualifications as a
        candidate for employment. Documents that encourage the User to "email for more details" are not permitted.
        Documents from any third party charging a fee or restricting complete access to all resume information are
        prohibited. </p>

    <p>(d) Resume postings must contain the accurate resume of a living individual seeking employment on a full-time,
        part-time, or contractual basis on his or her own behalf. </p>

    <p>(e) CareerBuilder is under no obligation to monitor the Documents posted on the Talent Network, but it may
        monitor Documents at random. Documents found to violate the above Posting Rules may be removed at

    </p>

    <p><b>12.2
        Conduct Rules:</b>
    </p>

    <p>(a) You may not respond to postings by other Users in any manner or for any purpose other than that which is

    <p>(b) You may not send unsolicited commercial email to Users, including electronic communications that offer,
        advertise, market or promote a product or service. </p>

    <p>(c) Protect your password. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your information and
        password. You are responsible for all uses of your registration, whether or not authorized by you. If others use
        your password to post inappropriate material on the Talent Network, you risk losing your access to the Talent
        Network. You agree to notify CareerBuilder immediately of any unauthorized use of your registration and
        password.</p>

    <p>(d) Report inappropriate postings or conduct to Feedback. </p>

    <p>(e) You may not delete or revise any material posted by any other person or entity. </p>

    <p>(f) If at any time CareerBuilder comes to the understanding that you: (i) misled CareerBuilder regarding your

        CareerBuilder reserves the right to terminate your Agreement.
    </p>

    <p><b>12.3
        Security Rules:</b>

    <p>
        (a) Users are prohibited from violating or attempting to violate the security of the Talent Network, including,
        without limitation: (i) accessing data not intended for such User or logging into a server or account which the

        or other electronic communications, including promotions and/or advertising of products or services; (v) forging
        any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any e-mail or newsgroup posting or providing
        false or misleading representations in the sender information, subject line, locator, or content of any
        electronic message; (iv) altering transmission data without consent; (v) harvesting e-mail or other electronic
        addresses through automated means without consent. </p>

    <p>
        (b) Violation of these Security Rules may result in civil or criminal liability. CareerBuilder will investigate
        occurrences which may involve such violations and may involve, and cooperate with, law enforcement authorities

        response to an infringement notice, we will make reasonable attempts to contact the owner or administrator of
        the affected site or content. If you feel that your material does not constitute infringement, you may provide
        CareerBuilder with a counter notification by written communication to the attention of "Trust and Site Security"
        at <a href="mailto:TSST@careerbuilder.com">TSST@careerbuilder.com</a> that sets forth all of the necessary

    <p>
        CareerBuilder, LLC and its subsidiaries and divisions (collectively, “CareerBuilder”, “We” or “Our”) provides the Talent Network on behalf of the employer whose career and employment opportunities are promoted on this Talent Network.

The phrase “Personal Information” refers to information that may be used to personally identify you, such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card number or other billing information.  We also describe the measures we take to help protect the security of your Personal Information and how you can contact us about our privacy practices.  Please do not provide us with highly sensitive information such as Social Security Numbers, financial information or health records.

    <h2 id="information-we-share">INFORMATION WE SHARE</h2>
    <p>
        When you join the Talent Network or apply for a job through the Talent Network, we provide your Personal Information to the employer customer who has hired CareerBuilder to create and operate this Talent Network on its behalf, (including your e-mail address and other contact information that you publish on your resume). The employer customer may use your information to contact you directly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, when you join the Talent Network or apply for a job through the Talent Network, the information supplied by you is stored by CareerBuilder on a dedicated database on behalf of the employer customer.  In addition, the information supplied by you also may become part of the employer customer’s database. In that instance, the use of such information by the employer customer will be subject to the privacy policy of that company, and CareerBuilder is not responsible for that company’s use of your information. CareerBuilder is not responsible for what the employer customer, or any third party with whom you may share your Personal Information, subsequently does with your information.  You should review the privacy policy of the employer customer to ensure that you are comfortable with how it intends to use and disclose your information.
    </p>
    <p>
        The employer customer for whom we act as a service provider to operate this Talent Network will receive reports that contain non-personally identifiable information about its Talent Network. We also use non-personally identifiable information and certain technical information about your computer and your access of the Talent Network (including your internet protocol address) in order to operate, maintain and manage the Talent Network.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, we may combine certain non-personally identifiable aggregate data about our users and use such anonymous aggregate data to prepare reports for our users (typically employers or educators).  “Aggregate Data” is the demographic information (such as zip code, age, gender, race or ethnicity) and employment information (such as occupation, education and experience) of many individuals that is combined together.  Aggregate data is used to analyze the characteristics of various populations and does not identify any specific individuals.  For example, an employer may purchase a report from CareerBuilder that states the number of accountants with at least five year’s experience that live within a certain geographic area.  All such reports sold only contain aggregate data which cannot be used to identify any individuals.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other than instances where users opt to provide their Personal Information while registering to join the Talent Network, provide it via a job application, or otherwise provide permission to share it, we do not sell our users' Personal Information to anyone for any reason.  All users should be aware, however, that when they choose to display or distribute Personal Information (such as their email address or other contact information) via the Talent Network or any other distribution method, that information can be collected and used by others. This may result in unsolicited messages, for which CareerBuilder is not responsible, from third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
        <br>
        We also may share Personal Information with our service providers who help us in the delivery of our own products and services to you. These service providers may only use or disclose the information as necessary to perform services on our behalf or as otherwise required by law.
    </p>
    <p>
        CareerBuilder also may disclose specific user information when we determine, in good faith, that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law, to cooperate with or seek assistance from law enforcement, to prevent a crime or protect national security, or to protect the interests or safety of CareerBuilder or other users of the Talent Network.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, Personal Information we have collected may be passed on to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets or a bankruptcy or other corporate reorganization of CareerBuilder.

        A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor‘s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser.  A “web beacon,” is also called a Web bug or a pixel tag or a clear GIF.

Lastly, CareerBuilder uses cookies to ensure the proper functioning and efficiency of the Talent Network.

    <p>
        CareerBuilder permits third party cookies on its Talent Network.  For example, third party tools located on the Talent Network may use cookies to remember user preference settings.  CareerBuilder also uses web analytics services provided by third parties, which use cookies to collect non-personal information about details of our users’ visits to the Talent Network (including IP addresses) and the resources they access on the Talent Network.  These third party web analytics services provide us with reports based on this information in order to help us understand how visitors engage with the Talent Network.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, the employer that uses this Talent Network may place cookies on your computer through their job postings and may use such cookies to distinguish your web browser uniquely.  Often, employers use such information to track the effectiveness of their job postings by measuring how many users who view their postings later became job applicants.
